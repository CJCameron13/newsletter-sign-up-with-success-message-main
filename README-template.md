## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Add their email and submit the form
- See a success message with their email after successfully submitting the form
- See form validation messages if:
  - The field is left empty
  - The email address is not formatted correctly
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

I began with my HTML markup. Adding all necessary elements and images. Linked my stylesheet and Javascript file. I styled the main card with it's hover states and error states. I then added the event listener for the subscribe button. Styled the success page, and completed the rest of the Javascript. Lasty, I created the mobile version of the page.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS
- Flexbox
- Javascript

### What I learned

What I am most happy about with this project is that I didn't get stuck or stumped at any point. I was able to apply skills that I have previously learned. I was prepared for the user email population on the success page to be tricky, but I didn't have any trouble making it happen. It feels good that some of the basic Javascript concepts are beginning to feel routine.

### Continued development

My continued focus in this phase of learning is fluency with my Javascript. Soon I will look to implement APIs into my projects. Once I have 2 or 3 of those under my belt I will start looking into frameworks.
